# Ambrosus Node API

Welcome to Ambrosus Node API Documentation.  

### Authentication
Before you can start interacting with API you need to create an account. An account is a pair: address and secret.

Depending on the type of operation you want to perform you are required to provide one of two forms of authentication: signed content or token based.

For entity upload operations the body of the request needs to contain a `content.signature` field. It is generated by signing the [serialized](Serialization) `content.idData` object using the standard ethereum sign function and your private key.

For other operations (modifying accounts and querying entities) a token should be provided using the http authorization header with `AMB_TOKEN ...` . The calculation of a token is described in the [Token section](Token). 

There is a special third option where you provide a http authorization header `AMB ...` with your account private key. When doing so the gateway will calculate the signature for you. This mechanism can be enabled using a config parameter. __Warning__: Sharing your private key is a security risk. This mechanism should therefore only be used in development and testing environments.  

### Immutability

__Note:__ All data is immutable, therefore, you will not find update or delete calls.

## Serialization [Serialization] 

When serialising data for hashing and signing, special care needs to be taken so that the result is deterministic. Otherwise the output values may not match, and lead to validation errors. Following rules need to be followed:

* The JSON is serialized to a single-line string without any whitespace characters outside of strings
* All fields in objects are sorted lexicographically
* In other aspects the output should match `JSON.stringify`

## Hashing

Hashes are a very important part of proving the persistence and the immutability of the data. All hashes in the AMB-NODE are computed using the ethereum standard `hashMessage` function as described in [web3 docs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-accounts.html#hashmessage). The underlying hash function is [Keccak256](https://keccak.team/index.html). 

### Errors

The majority of errors along to the error code provide additional information in `body` with following format:
```{json}
{
  "reason": "What happened"
}
```

## Group Token [Token]

Some requests like account management or accessing to restricted data fields require an access token for authorization. The access token is a base64-encoded [serialized](Serialization) JSON file of following format:
```$json
{
  "signature": $SIGNATURE,
  "idData": {
    "createdBy": $ADDRESS,
    "validUntil": $TIMESTAMP
  }
}
```
where $ADDRESS is your public address and $TIMESTAMP is a UNIX-styled integer specifying token's expiration date.
$SIGNATURE is an elliptic-curve signature of the idData field. Should be signed with the creator's private address. We recommend to create the token locally and use it across Ambrosus API without sending your private key anywhere.
### /token

## Group Account
Used for compatibility with an old Dashboard.

## Group Account2

An account represents an actor in the supply chain. This can be a person, a company, a location, etc.

It consists of a pair - a public identifer `address` (compatible with ethereum address) and a `secret` (compatible with ethereum private key). Additionally an account has a list of permissions, which specify what actions user can perform and an access levels, which specifies what data is user able to view.

Account can hold any number of following permissions:

* super_account - Almighty administrator account. Is able to perform all kinds of calls.
* protected_account - account protected from modification. Protected accounts can be created only by super accounts or other protected accounts. Only super accounts can modify the protected accounts. 
* create_asset - allows account to create assets
* create_event - allows account to create events
* register_accounts - allows account to add new accounts
* manage_accounts - allows account to view and manage existing accounts

## Group Asset
Used for compatibility with an old Dashboard.

## Group Asset2

Assets are primary elements moving through a supply chain. The are the nouns of the system. They can represent an ingredient, product, package of products or any other type of container.

An Asset on its own function only as a handle for a Event stream. Because of this, they only contain an `idData` structure holding minimal information about their creation.

Assets are identified by an `assetId` field which is a sha3 hash calculated from the `content` field.

### /asset2/list{?perPage,page,createdBy,fromTimestamp,toTimestamp,identifier}

#### Find assets [GET]

Finds assets satisfying provided criteria.

+ Parameters

    + perPage (integer, optional) - number of assets to return per page (limited to 100)
    + page (integer, optional) - number of page (more search results than specified in perPage parameter concludes more than one page)
    + createdBy (string, optional) - address of account that created targeting assets
    + fromTimestamp (integer, optional) - earliest timestamp for the asset
    + toTimestamp (integer, optional) - latest timestamp for the asset
    + identifier : identifier[{identifierType}]={identifierValue} (string, optional) - This syntax allows to query for assets that have an associated event containing data type `ambrosus.event.identifier` (see Events Data field section) with same identifier of same type. It is possible to find identifiers matching a pattern with help of the pattern decorator. You can use like this: identifier[vin]=pattern(3FRNF65N*). It supports 2 kinds of special characters:
      - __*__ matches any string, including the null string.
      - __?__ matches any single character
      Note that patterns cannot have a special character as the first symbol for performance reasons. It is not possible to escape special characters.

## Group Event

Used for compatibility with an old Dashboard.

## Group Events2

Events describe all registered changes of state that occurred with the asset. E.g. measured temperature, noted big acceleration or changing pallets. An event consists of the 3 major parts:

* idData – Public information about an event. Contains the ID of the asset, address of the user who has registered the event, minimal access level required to view private data of the event and the timestamp of the event. Additionally idData holds the hash of the Data field.
* Data – Protected information about an event. To get access to the private data, a user needs to have an access level not smaller than the returned event.
* Metadata – Information generated and used by AMB-NET, for example id of a bundle handling an event.

##### Events Data field

Every event has a `data` array, located at `content` with information what actually happened.
Each item in this array is an object with a required `type` field of `string` type.
Following event types are predefined:
* `ambrosus.asset.info` - Human readable information about an asset, such as its name, photos, description, etc.
* `ambrosus.asset.identifiers` - Known identifiers for an asset, must have at least 1 property of type `array`
* `ambrosus.event.identifiers` - Known identifiers for an event, must have at least 1 property of type `array`
* `ambrosus.asset.location` - Location of an asset. Can be expressed with geographical coordinates.
    * `geoJson`: geographical point described with geoJson formula (As described in RFC7946, The GeoJSON Format)
* `ambrosus.event.location` - Location of an event. Can be expressed with geographical coordinates.
    * `geoJson`: geographical point described with geoJson formula (As described in RFC7946, The GeoJSON Format)


### /event2/list{?assetId,fromTimestamp,toTimestamp,perPage,page,createdBy,data}

#### Find events [GET]

Finds event satisfying provided criteria.

+ Parameters

    + assetId (string, optional) - ID of the asset the events are targeting
    + fromTimestamp (integer, optional) - earliest timestamp for the events
    + toTimestamp (integer, optional) - latest timestamp for the events
    + perPage (integer, optional) - number of events to return per page (limited to 100)
    + page (integer, optional) - number of page (more search results than specified in perPage parameter concludes more than one page)
    + createdBy (string, optional) - address of account that created targeting events
    + data : data[type]=ambrosus.event.custom (object, optional) - This syntax allows to query for events by any fields in data array. Query for nested fields is possible, e.g. data[acceleration.x]=10. By default the type of the value is string. To provide a number, use data[acceleration.x]=number(10). To provide geo coordinates use data[geoJson]=geo(longitude, latitude, radius). It is possible to match data values by the pattern using the pattern decorator like so `data[type]=pattern(ambrosus.event.*)`. It support 2 kinds of special characters:
       - __*__ matches any string, including the null string.
       - __?__ matches any single character
       Note that patterns cannot have a special character as the first symbol for performance reasons. It is not possible to escape special characters.
